## About Me

I am a graduate student in climate science with a background in physical oceanography.  
My work focuses on **climate data analysis**, **remote sensing**, and **ocean–atmosphere interactions**.

***Data-driven, research-oriented, and interdisciplinary.***

> I enjoy working with real-world climate datasets  
> and translating complex scientific questions  
> into clear, reproducible analyses.
